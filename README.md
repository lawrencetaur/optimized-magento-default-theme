#  stripped/optimized magento default theme (http://www.magentocommerce.com/)

This repository contains adjustments for a vanilla Magento CE 1.6.0 install.
Since the default theme of Magento is a fallback from all other themes, it makes sense to optimize all frontend files for best speed performance.

## Features:
* Optimized PNGs by Smush.itâ„¢ (http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/)
* Concatenated/Optimized Stylesheets
* Incorporated html5boilerplate in default theme (https://github.com/zeljkoprsa/Magento-Boilerplate)
* Normalized Form Styles by Formalize (http://formalize.me/)
